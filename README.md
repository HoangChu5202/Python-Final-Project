# Final Project
This is the final project for my CIS-207 Fundamentals of Web Programming course at [Kirkwood Community College](https://www.kirkwood.edu)
## Introduction
This week I learn about Git, Github and Visual Code. This is my fisrt time to learn it and it really fun.

This is what I learned in GitHub:

    - Create a new project
    - How to add a file from my computer to GitHub
    - How to pull and push a file to GitHub

I also learn some basic thing in markdown too.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Computers and Programming
This week I learned about how a computer work, part requied to make a device call a computer.
The way that computer work is:
-   Get input from any input devices.
-   Processing infomation: this will happen in Central processing unit (CPU) and Main memory/Random Access Memory (RAM).
-   Output: This will display result to your output devices, usually is monitor.
I also learned about binary number how to change from demical to binary.

I also know about some popular language like:
- Java
- Html
- Python
- C#
And so on.

## Chapter 2 - Input, Processing, and Output
In this chapter I learned about some basic step when a programer write their code.
Fist they'll read the task and try to see what do they need to do. Then they will create a pseudocode, after that they will draw a flowchart, then they will make a Algorithms.
I aslo learned about some data type like: int, float, string and boolean.
Output(or display), comments and formatting is the next thing that i learned.
To Concatenation 2 string I have to write code like this:

```Python
first_name = "Marc"
last_name = "Hauschildt"
room = 503
print(first_name + last_name + " is staying in room number " + str(room))
```
Anything read by `input()` alway in string data type. If I want to read it as a number I have to write `int(input())` or `float(input())`
Mathematical Operators:
-   \+ plus, - minus,  * multiplication

-   / float division, // integer division, % remainder division

-   ** exponent

Short cut to Increase/Decrease Numerical Variables:
variable += N
"+" can be replace by "-" to Minus or "*" to Mutiple.
